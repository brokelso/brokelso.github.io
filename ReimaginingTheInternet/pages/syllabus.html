            possible. Practice in the design innovation, programming, and assessment of web-based digital multimedia
            information systems. Intended for students in non-technical disciplines. Graduate version of undergrad
            course also includes higher-level exploration of Javascript topics and frameworks, WebGL/3D, and data
            visualization and a more substantive final project than undergrad section.

            Imagining the Internet’s Interface: This course is a creative coding course using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
            designed to encourage both technical skills and critical design. We will spend significant time looking at
            the history of internet art and design as well as current practices. We will also develop the skill of art
            critiques—perceiving and theorizing the style of, function of, and statements made by web interfaces. How do
            we imagine the internet when we build it? What possibilities do we open and what do we foreclose? In what
            (or whose) image of the world is this imagination?

        There are 6 projects in this course totaling to 600 graded points in the course. Each project's final grade
        is weighted by:<br>
        <br>
        1. Timely submission of assignments leading up to final project (check marked): 30%<br>
        2. Demonstration of technical skills learned: 30%<br>
        3. Project’s concept, creativity, and craft: 30%<br>
        4. Attendance and participation in class discussion and critiques: 10%<br>
        <br>
        Grade cutoffs:<br>
        A+:97%<br>
        A:93%<br>
        A-:90%<br>

        D:60%-70%<br>
        If your final course grade is on the border of a higher grade, consistent class engagement may bump the
        grade up.<br>

                    these
                    guidelines. Please reach out to me and your academic dean as soon as possible if you need to

                    <br>
                    For technical help with Sakai or Zoom, contact the Duke OIT Service Desk at
                    https://oit.duke.edu/help. You can

                    2. Rules for Video Recording Course Content
                    <br>
                    Student recording of lectures must be permitted by the instructor and shall be for private study
                    only. Such
                    recordings shall not be distributed to anyone else without authorization by the instructor whose
                    lecture has
                    been recorded. However, the instructor may arrange through the Office of Information Technology to
                    make recorded
                    lectures available to students enrolled in the class on such terms and conditions as he or she
                    prescribes.
                    Unauthorized distribution is a cause for disciplinary action by the Judicial Board. The full policy
                    on recoding
                    of lectures falls under the Duke University Policy on Intellectual Property Rights, available here
                    (p. 15):

                    <br>
                    Students are permitted by university policy to be absent from class to observe a religious holiday.
                    Accordingly,
                    Trinity College of Arts & Sciences and the Pratt School of Engineering have established procedures
                    to be
                    followed by students for notifying their instructors of an absence necessitated by the observance of
                    a religious
                    holiday. Please submit requests for religious accommodations at the beginning of the semester so
                    that we can
                    work to make suitable arrangements well ahead of time. You can find the policy and relevant
