                <b>A Same Page: Experimenting with Individualization Refusal</b>
                The University is a structure that performs the individualization of its actors. What happens when we
                refuse this fact and work against the acquired behavior of distinguishing ourselves from and positioning
                ourselves against one another? What happens when we do things together, when we think and write
                together—and this by being literally on the same page? During one afternoon workshop, we will think
                about and experiment around the blank page—the google doc, the etherpad, the firepad—as a
                material-imaginary “subjectile” (Derrida). A subjectile is never blank; it is always overc(r)o(w)ded
                with expectations (our own, the ones of our field of research, of the advisors etc.), with power
                structures, with the discourse of others against or with which we position ourselves. We want to offer
                you an experiment—in the spirit of a camp-lab—during which we learn to create another kind of working,
                thinking relationship with one another.

                <b>Individualization Refusal: An Introduction</b>
                <br>
                Your time is precious. Perhaps, you are wondering why you are here today, what this afternoon will bring
                you while you could be working on your PhD. We are aware that the material conditions of graduate
                students in the U.K. are different from those in the U.S. where one can be offered a five year PhD
                financed by the institution. Or in Germany where one gets three years of scholarship to write a
                dissertation in what is called a “Graduiertenschule.” In the U.S. and in Germany, the graduate students
                owe all of their time to the academic institution. Here, it seems to be the opposite. The university
                owes you. So today, my study partners and I are in the position of contractors, here to provide you with
                a service. Your time is precious and we are indebted to your giving us some of it. We owe you. And
                still, we may not give you exactly what you might expect—that is, some knowledge readily applicable to
                your individual research.

                We do not intend to downplay the necessity and obligation tied to an academic career. We all had, or
                still have to write our qualification works a certain way, following certain codes and fulfilling
                expectations to assure the institution that we are qualified to perpetuate its purpose. Its main purpose
                is, following Harney and Moten’s analysis, professionalization in order to fully integrate a highly
                specialized labor force. In doing so, the University performs the “privatization” of the individual.

                What we have been practicing in our humanities lab—S-1 at Duke University in Durham, NC—is to
                simultaneously walk a parallel way, write a parallel text to the one expected from us as academics. We
                do it under the guise of study and performance. We have become a practical-speculative work-group. This
                group escapes the expectations of the university, at least partly, while at the same time “stealing from
                it” by channeling its social and economic capital towards other purposes.

                By working, thinking and writing together on this parallel path, we have been refusing the
                individualization of academic labor. We have been seeking ways to interrupt the habitus of working
                against one another, of distinguishing ourselves from the others. We refuse, for a moment, to compete in
                the violent scarcity economy that is the academe, where it always seems that there are too many of us
                and that we are never enough.

                Working together, as we plan on doing today, is a possible way of performing critique: an embodied way
                or, as I like to say, a critique in touch; a critique that does not believe in the possibility of
                maintaining a safe distance with its objects; a critique that accepts to be affected by its object while
                it hopes to have an effect on it. I am aware that the concept of “object” is limited when trying to
                describe the kind of relationality implied by a critique “in touch.”

                What is a humanities lab? As we discovered during the past year and a half, a humanities lab entails a
                speculative and a practical dimension. These two dimensions stand in unresolved tension with one
                another. There is a gap between speculation and practice that needs to be practically and not solely
                theoretically acknowledged. This is a big and sometimes painful difference to recognize. I think that
                negotiating this gap constitutes the political core of our lab’s work. Connected to this issue is for
                instance the question of division of labor inside the lab: who does what work and whose work is
                recognized, paid, non-paid etc. Since these issues are very frustrating, why not just speculate? Why not
                stay at the safer distance of observation? It became increasingly clear to us that we couldn’t afford to
                only speculate, if we wanted to take our theoretical readings seriously.

                We do not claim to solve problems or affect big changes. Instead, it is more about operating shifts. In
                being “in” the institution without being “of” the institution to quote Harney and Moten, we operate what
                we could describe as a practical, performative deconstruction that displaces stuff in us and hopefully
                in the people we collaborate with. While rejecting the institution would imply acknowledging it, letting
                its power fully determine the scope of our actions—plus, we need to eat—, shifting its components from
                the inside allows us to create some movement (jeu) in its structure, to create new habits, and form new
                alliances.

                We have been thinking about the institution and its surrounding as an algorithm, a series of often
                recursive procedures through which the institution produces and reproduces itself. S-1 lab was
                originally a speculative lab working on digital technologies that in 2019 we refused to continue
                producing. Instead, we have been seeking to invent new algorithms, new material procedures or chains of
                operations, capable of overwriting and reprogramming the old ones—while also acknowledging how we need
                to constantly rethink and reformulate what we are doing. These algorithms propagate, transform us and
                give us strength like a muscle through habit and repetition. Later today, we will run one of these
                algorithms together. We will be for a time on “a same page” and we will see if we can rewrite some of
                the codes crowding the “subjectile,” in our case the academic blank page.

                What we hope to reach through this camp/lab session with you is to find some pleasure in the refusal to
                be individualized, in other words to have fun in writing, thinking, doing together. “Being on the same
                page” doesn’t mean agreeing on everything. Instead, it means occupying for a limited time a common
                material ground—the google doc—and cooperating in it with generosity and care. In doing so, we accept to
                let go of some of our fear of being judged, of ownership over the product of our subjectivity. And we
                hope to tighten our bonds.
