            <h2>I. “NOTHING IS POSSIBLE”</h2><br>
            <p>
                The project “Nothing Is Possible” was about exploring what happens—on a sensory and conceptual
                level—when one does nothing. It was a kind of social and aesthetic experiment. We sought collaborators
                at a non-profit science research park close to Durham, North Carolina, called “Research Triangle Park.”
                This research park maintains its non-profit—meaning tax-exempt—status thanks to a very minimal
                contribution to the surrounding community: it offers a coworking space called “Frontier” with free
                internet. This space is designed for freelance workers who are part of the gig economy. These workers
                hustle their way from one job to the next in a state of perpetual precariousness. Beyond free internet,
                working at Frontier gives them the legitimacy of having an “office” outside of their private living
                space.<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                During a presentation at Frontier, we solicited coworkers interested in collaborating on “doing nothing”
                during one hour. (By the way, a similar project was launched a few months after we started, at the
                Kunstakademie in Hamburg.) We let these co-workers set the price for the said hour of doing nothing and
                abstained from setting any expectation regarding what nothing is, or what they should do during this
                hour. Perhaps to our surprise, it wasn’t easy to find collaborators willing to be paid for doing
                nothing. For instance, as we interviewed potential collaborators, several of these “job candidates” took
                issue with being paid without having to be productive:
            </p><br>
            <blockquote>
                How much would you ask to be paid to do nothing for an hour during your workday?” Answer: “It depends
                who’s paying? If my employer paid me to sabbath -> (rest) for an hour during the workday, I wouldn’t ask
                for more than what they’re already paying me to work. If someone outside of work paid me to not work
                while I’m supposed to be working, it would be much more (not sure what price I’d put on it) since I
                would be risking my reputation and job to not work.
            </blockquote><br>
            <p>
                This experiment was a means for us to challenge productivity and its moral valuation, to reflect on how
                wages are set, and how surplus-value is extracted in late capitalist societies. It allowed us to put
                Duke’s social and economic capital in circulation beyond the limits of the institution. No sooner had we
                finished this social experiment than Covid-19 broke out and a vast amount of the U.S. population was
                stuck at home, forced to do nothing. Covid-19 became the large-scale version of our experiment. It
                allowed us to see how attention is freed when there is much less labor to be done. Suddenly, there was
                space for seeing and feeling what had been left out of the perceptual frame for so long, namely
                injustice: not only as a philosophical concept but also as the lived, quotidian experience of the U.S.
                Black and brown population. The killing of George Floyd by the police in front of the cameras—something
                that happens on a quasi-weekly basis in the United States—suddenly appeared inacceptable to a vast
                number of white people stuck at home. Within a few days, tens of thousands took to the streets on the
                side of Black Lives Matter demonstrators.

            </p><br>
            <p>
            <h4>A. Study—Working Against University as a Program for Individualization</h4>
            </p><br>
            <p>
                What we did during the “Nothing Is Possible” experiment shares similar traits with what Stefano Harney
                and Fred Moten have elaborated under the notion of “Study.” To Harney and Moten, study is not what the
                student does in order to be ready to sell their workforce inside or outside academia. Rather, study is
                the activity of being affected, of letting oneself be affected by others—as the condition for working or
                doing together. Study is contrary to the academic project of individualization. To Harney and Moten, the
                figure of the student is a prime example of an “affected body” (Da Silva), possessed and dispossessed by
                the language and practices of others. The University’s job is usually to bring students to overcome this
                “immaturity” in order to turn them into self-determined individuals ready to join the workforce.<a
                    href="#note1">¹</a> Harney
                and Moten understand the university as a place where everything goes against collective, collaborative
                production of knowledge.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                The concept of study should be replaced in a larger abolitionist framework. The concept of abolition has
                experienced significant transformations during the past two decades. While the term originally served to
                describe the abolition of slavery, it now defines a movement against a set of institutions that
                perpetuates to this day structures of subjection similar to slavery, which Angela Davis calls “the
                prison industrial complex.” It includes prisons, police, the justice system etc. Abolition doesn’t
                solely mean putting an end to these institutions; rather it implies changing society to such a degree
                that these institutions become superfluous. Abolition is destruction through the creation of a new
                society.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                One of the central arguments in Harney and Moten’s reflection in The Undercommons is the idea that we
                are connected to each other through “bad debt”; a bad debt is a debt that can never be repaid—contrary
                to the “good debt” that functions as “credit,” that has value and must be paid eventually. While the
                goal of late capitalist societies is to turn bad debt into credit, tying debt to the cycle of capital
                and privatization, Harney and Moten insist on the necessity of maintaining bad, unpayable debt as a
                means of socialization. This kind of bad, unpayable debt is what ties us to one another. It is the
                common of the Undercommons. From the perspective of bad debt, studying means doing things with each
                other, doing things for each other, so that we are always indebted to each other. Study is a way of
                assembling that is not limited to the context of the university. It is a form of sociality. For Harney
                and Moten, assemblies always entail a level of intellectuality. And intellectuality, on the other hand,
                is immediately social. Harney and Moten point, for instance, to the “intellectuality” of practices of
                assembly like dancing, singing, working together etc. In that sense, study could be a fruitful concept
                for us to think about the political-intellectual potential of all kinds of assemblies and to reflect on
                what we are doing when we are doing research together. More concretely, and with our work of common
                knowledge production in mind, study could mean thinking with and through others, rather than thinking in
                place of others (like in politics) or against others (as is too often the case in academia).

            <blockquote>
                No mourning of the impossible revolutions can get in the way of the human strikers because human strike
                is not a mission, nor a project or a program. It is the gesture that makes legible the silent political
                element in everything: women’s lives, the dissatisfaction of rich people, the anger of privileged
                teenagers, the refusal to submit to the mediocrity of necessity, ordinary racism, and so on.

            <p><br>
                With the collaborative project “Nothing Is Possible,” we sought to go beyond the critique of
                institutions and its mainly discursive formulations towards critical making. One of the shortcomings of
                a critique of the institution is that it is part of the reproduction of university as an institution.
                “It allows us to experience ourselves as if we are outside of the institution while remaining firmly
                ensconced in its liberal narrative of self-valorization.”<a href="#note2">²</a> In the early stages of
                the project, we became
                aware of our problematic position as Duke collaborators regarding any project that claims to question
                the institution from the perspective of disconnected observers. We, as professors, students, and
                affiliated researchers, are the body of the institution; each day we accept to participate in these
                identities, we organize and reform the institution into what we simultaneously study away from.
            </p>
            <p><br>
                With this understanding of our position, we turned toward performance art that interrogates sites of
                positionality and the relationships in-between. We looked at artist Rirkrit Tiravanija, who cooked Thai
                food in galleries for his audience. We looked at the work by Santiago Sierra that employs immigrants and
                refugees to sit in galleries, illegally paid at minimum wages. We also looked at performances by Marina
                Abramovic, such as The Artist is Present which aims to produce immediate, intimate connections with
                strangers. All of these works create an aesthetic of relationships that might be uniting, rearranging,
                antagonistic, or alienating.
            </p>
            <p><br>
                We agreed that accepting ourselves as part of the institution of the university, with the power to
                employ participants and offer social (intellectual) capital to the Research Triangle Park was the first,
                strategic step to reforming ourselves away from the university, while at the same time accepting the
                impossible position of being inside and outside of it. This position, as problematic and difficult as it
                is, seems the only one that allows a transformation of the institution: displacing or opening its
                borders, challenging its conception of knowledge-making and productivity. With our object of study,
                doing nothing as a bureaucratic and technological dispositive, we refused to make within the existing,
                institutionally acknowledged boundaries, and we asked the co-workers at Frontier to do the same within
                the context of their workday.
            </p><br>
            <h2>III. THE PRACTICE OF WRITING TOGETHER</h2>
            <p><br>
                As doing nothing became a generalized condition under the pandemic, we felt that our project might allow
                us to reflect on this new global context. The challenge was to produce a document that embodied our
                individual and collective thinking, turning the social experiment into the material of our reflection.
                We, as professors, postdocs, doctoral candidates, wrote together on the same day, at the same time, in
                the same shared Google Doc over Zoom. When we started writing, everyone went silent. Over the course of
                our short meeting, we ended up writing fifteen wild and rich pages.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                What is characteristic for this text is that we agreed to keep a floating I. For this reason, the text
                is marked by a certain degree of deindividualization: the “I” functions as the indexical mark of
                unidentified bodies of differentiated status within the institution. These people coexist under the I in
                the text. They accept to be taken for each other: the professor for the student, the postdoc for the
                professor. This way of writing together goes against the grain of the University as a mechanism of
                individualization. Someone’s I becomes part of me. I, in return, accept to be identified with a text I
                might have written differently. I became other. The deterritorialization of the I ingresses
                institutional hierarchies between professor and student: the authority of the authorial stretches along
                general sentences, contracts into the particular “Is,” and gets reabsorbed into another. This
                collectivization differs from the “we” of the natural science papers where the consensus is established
                in advance and where the roles are highly codified through the order of the names at the beginning of
                the paper.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                Of course, writing together isn’t an easy process. We experienced different levels of participation and
                engagement. These varying levels of participation followed varying consensus on procedure. Often, only a
                fraction of the group enacted what had been discussed during meetings.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                We decided to not name authors but agreed that the disappearance of the authors shouldn’t amount to the
                disappearance of who got the work done. This is why we kept a log at the beginning of the book.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                How to describe writing-together as a cultural technique with its chain of operation, or—as we called
                it—its algorithm. Such an algorithm didn’t preexist the act of writing together. As is often the case,
                how to assemble emerges out of doing the assembling. It entails a certain amount of
                improvisation—accepting the unplanned, unexpected, unforeseeable. The performance of writing together
                brings something to existence that couldn’t exist before or without it. It is something else than the
                sum of its parts. It happens differently every time.
            </p><br>
            <h2>IV. CONCLUSION</h2>
            <p><br>
                Our “Nothing Is Possible” project was a “theoretical practice” in which we tried to do “practical
                theory.” We could call it “Relational Studies.” Contrary to the relational aesthetics, in which the
                artist is responsible for the rearranging of relations, we let go of our authorial predetermination and
                stable “I”s. We used strategy, agreeing to speak the language of the institutions, and adopting their
                habitus in order to repurpose it. We reappropriated the tools of the University—the language of the
                institution, its functioning, its internal structure, its bureaucratic rules. In a way, we stole these
                tools, modified them, repurposed them, and turned them against their hegemonic function. Under
                “Relational Studies” we sought to produce a relational, embedded critique of institutions, and of
                knowledge production, that acknowledge our position in the institution, our dependence on it and on its
                legitimacy, in order to transform it, even if only a little bit.
